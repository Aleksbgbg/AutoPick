# AutoPick
AutoPick is a program which accepts, calls your lane, and auto-picks your champion during blind pick champion select in League of Legends.

Although primarily intended for blind pick, runes and draft pick may soon be implemented.

Currently only works on 1280x720 clients and the UI is not very advanced - improvements are being worked on.

If the program misbehaves, it can be disabled by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F2` and re-enabled by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F3`.

To get a release version you can run, right click `publish.ps1` and press `Run with PowerShell`, or execute `powershell ./publish.ps1` in the current directory. The script will produce a runnable executable `AutoPick.exe`.
